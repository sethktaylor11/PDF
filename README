You can use the major program features by modifying the simulation parameters
in src/config.h and recompiling. The functions of the parameters are:

mesh - which mesh will appear in the simulation. Provided meshes include box.2,
tank2.1, cylinder.1 and balloon.1. The cylinder and balloon meshes are much
finer than the other meshes and require smaller time steps to simulate without
blowup (about 0.005 for tank2 and 0.002 for cylinder). You can add new meshes to
the simulation by adding in a corresponding .node, .face, .ele and .neigh file
to /meshes, but there are some restrictions on the files. The restrictions are:
all files are zero-indexed
.node - nodes need 1 attribute which specifies if they are fixed (0 for free, 1
for fixed) and no boundary marker
.face - faces need a boundary marker and the indices of the tetrahedra containing
the faces
.ele - 4 nodes per tet and no attributes
.neigh - none

height - the amount the object is offset from the ground

floorStiffness - floor spring constant

CoR - coefficient of restitution

timeStep - time step size

delta - particle interaction radius

a - material parameter proportional to bulk modulus

b - material parameter proportional to shear modulus

damping - damping coefficient

criticalTension - the amount a bond has to strecth before breaking

criticalCompression - the amount a bond has to compress before breaking

gravity - gravity constant

pressureStart - initial gauge pressure

pressureTimeScaling - pressure increase per time step

pressurized - which boundary is pressurized (in the provided examples, 1 for
exterior faces and 2 for interior faces)
